*What I Learned:*
This was my first project in Unity, and I would have changed much about the content of the game with more time, but I was very happy with the process that I employed. To ensure I had a working product, every couple of days, I would have a full working version that could be published even with limited functionality, up to the deadline.

Much of the code is uncommented, and I would love to now make a commit with proper documentation, but I want to stay true to the time constraint and use this as a learning process to document code, even when rapid-prototyping.

All-in-all I had an amazing time making this project and and very happy with the output.
